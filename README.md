The theme of the project is a web product for the bike shop "My Bike"
Due to creating this page, I use a site development methodology such as BEM.
The SCSS extension, which is one of the syntactic forms of the Sass preprocessor, was used to write the styles.
Using SCSS made things easier with features like nesting and mixins.
